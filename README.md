# Git Skills in the Real World

## Looking Back

Over the last section of lessons, we covered how to integrate a version control
system into your coding workflow. Specifically, we learned about Git and its
features, including:

- The benefits of using a VCS like Git
- Useful Git vocabulary terms
- How to initialize a Git repository
- How to check the status of a Git repository
- How to add changes to a Git commit
- How to clone a repository to your own local machine
- How to create a remote repository on GitHub
- How to connect a local repository to a remote repository
- How to push code to a remote repository
- How to manage code via the Learn IDE

These are all actions you'll be performing often, so don't worry if they don't
yet feel automatic or if you have to go back and check your commands. The more
you use Git, the easier it will be to incorporate it into your coding.

## Looking Ahead

Now that we have the basics, we can explore the more advanced features of Git.
Beyond the tools it gives us to organize and keep track of your own work, it
also allows us to collaborate with others. As you grow in your work as a coder,
you'll need to collaborate more and more. You might be working with a large team
that has to coordinate changes among several people at once. You might
contribute to an open source project where you submit code to be reviewed by the
community. Or you might share your own repository and accept others'
contributions yourself. In some situations, strong Git skills are just as
important, if not more so, than coding skills. You're now prepared to build on
your Git foundation so that you can expand your opportunities to make bigger and
better things.
